## What you should know first...

Poorly managed waste is contaminating the worlds oceans, clogging drains and causing flooding, transmitting diseases, increasing respiratory problems from burning, harming animals that consume waste unknowingly, and affecting economic development such as through tourism.

Without urgent action, these issues will only get worse. Heres what everyone should know.

## HEDONIST ROOTS

First, rapid urbanization, population growth, and economic development will push global waste generation to increase by 70% over the next 30 years.

Each year, the world generates more than 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste. Without urgent action, this will increase by nearly three quarters to 3.4 billion tonnes over the next 30 years. 

East Asia generates about one quarter of the worlds waste, while waste generation is growing the fastest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

While high-income countries account only for 16% of the global population, they generate over one-third of the worlds waste.
